"There is no built-in support for sessions because there is no *right* way to"
" do it (in a micro framework). Depending on requirements and environment you"
" could use beaker_ middleware with a fitting backend or implement it "
"yourself. Here is an example for beaker sessions with a file-based backend::"

#: ../../recipes.rst:45
msgid ""
"WARNING: Beaker's SessionMiddleware is not thread safe.  If two concurrent "
"requests modify the same session at the same time, one of the updates might "
"get lost. For this reason, sessions should only be populated once and "
"treated as a read-only store after that. If you find yourself updating "
"sessions regularly, and don't want to risk losing any updates, think about "
"using a real database instead or seek alternative session middleware "
"libraries."

"Bottle catches all Exceptions raised in your app code to prevent your WSGI "

"The werkzeug_ and paste_ libraries both ship with very powerful debugging "

"gevent_ async framework. Here is a sample that works with either the gevent_"
" HTTP server or the paste_ HTTP server (it may work with others, but I have "
