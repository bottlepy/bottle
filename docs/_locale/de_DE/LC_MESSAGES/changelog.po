"Bottle uses pickle to store arbitrary objects into signed cookies. This is "
"safe, as long as the signature key remains a secret. Unfortunately, people "
"tend to push code with signature keys to github all the time, so we decided "
"to remove pickle-support from bottle. Signed cookies will now issue a "
"deprecation warning if the value is not a string, and support for non-string"
" values will be removed in 0.14. The global :func:`cookie_encode`, "
":func:`cookie_decode` and :func:`is_cookie_encoded` are now also deprecated."
" If you are using this feature, think about using json to serialize your "
