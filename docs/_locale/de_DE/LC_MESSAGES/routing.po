"The :class:`Router` distinguishes between two basic types of routes: "
"**static routes** (e.g. ``/contact``) and **dynamic routes** (e.g. "
"``/hello/<name>``). A route that contains one or more *wildcards* it is "
"considered dynamic. All other routes are static."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routing.rst:14
msgid ""
"The simplest form of a wildcard consists of a name enclosed in angle "
"brackets (e.g. ``<name>``). The name should be unique for a given route and "
"form a valid python identifier (alphanumeric, starting with a letter). This "
"is because wildcards are used as keyword arguments for the request callback "
"later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routing.rst:16
msgid ""
"Each wildcard matches one or more characters, but stops at the first slash "
"(``/``). This equals a regular expression of ``[^/]+`` and ensures that only"
" one path segment is matched and routes with more than one wildcard stay "
"unambiguous."

msgid "Wildcard Filters"
msgstr ""

#: ../../routing.rst:36
msgid ""
"Filters are used to define more specific wildcards, and/or transform the "
"matched part of the URL before it is passed to the callback. A filtered "
"wildcard is declared as ``<name:filter>`` or ``<name:filter:config>``. The "
"syntax for the optional config part depends on the filter used."

"**:path** matches all characters including the slash character in a non-"
"greedy way and may be used to match more than one path segment."

#: ../../routing.rst:43

"**:re[:exp]** allows you to specify a custom regular expression in the "
"config field. The matched value is not modified."
msgstr ""

#: ../../routing.rst:45
msgid ""
"You can add your own filters to the router. All you need is a function that "
"returns three elements: A regular expression string, a callable to convert "
"the URL fragment to a python value, and a callable that does the opposite. "
"The filter function is called with the configuration string as the only "
"parameter and may parse it as needed::"
