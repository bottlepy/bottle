msgid "Bottle applications can store their configuration in :attr:`Bottle.config`, a dict-like object and central place for application specific settings. This dictionary controls many aspects of the framework, tells (newer) plugins what to do, and can be used to store your own configuration as well."

msgid "The :attr:`Bottle.config` object behaves a lot like an ordinary dictionary. All the common dict methods work as expected. Let us start with some examples::"

#: ../../configuration.rst:44
msgid "The app object is not always available, but as long as you are within a request context, you can use the `request` object to get the current application and its configuration::"

msgid "Naming Convention"
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:53
msgid "To make life easier, plugins and applications should follow some simple rules when it comes to config parameter names:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:55
msgid "All keys should be lowercase strings and follow the rules for python identifiers (no special characters but the underscore)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:56
msgid "Namespaces are separated by dots (e.g. ``namespace.field`` or ``namespace.subnamespace.field``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:57
msgid "Bottle uses the root namespace for its own configuration. Plugins should store all their variables in their own namespace (e.g. ``sqlite.db`` or ``werkzeug.use_debugger``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:58
msgid "Your own application should use a separate namespace (e.g. ``myapp.*``)."

#: ../../configuration.rst:66
msgid "Configuration files are useful if you want to enable non-programmers to configure your application, or just don't want to hack python module files just to change the database port. A very common syntax for configuration files is shown here:"

msgid "With :meth:`ConfigDict.load_config` you can load these ``*.ini`` style configuration files from disk and import their values into your existing configuration::"

#: ../../configuration.rst:89
msgid "Loading configuration from a Python module is a common pattern for Python programs and frameworks. Bottle assumes that configuration keys are all upper case:"

msgid "Listening to configuration changes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../configuration.rst:139
msgid "The ``config`` hook on the application object is triggered each time a value in :attr:`Bottle.config` is changed. This hook can be used to react on configuration changes at runtime, for example reconnect to a new database, change the debug settings on a background service or resize worker thread pools. The hook callback receives two arguments (key, new_value) and is called before the value is actually changed in the dictionary. Raising an exception from a hook callback cancels the change and the old value is preserved."

msgid "The hook callbacks cannot *change* the value that is to be stored to the dictionary. That is what filters are for."

#: ../../configuration.rst:165
msgid "A callable that accepts and returns a single value. If a filter is defined for a key, any new value stored to that key is first passed through the filter callback. The filter can be used to cast the value to a different type, check for invalid values (throw a ValueError) or trigger side effects."
