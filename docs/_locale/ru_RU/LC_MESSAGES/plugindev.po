msgid ""
"The plugin API builds on the concept of `decorators "
"<http://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-decorator>`_. To put it briefly, "
"a plugin is a decorator applied to every single route callback of an "
"application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:20
msgid ""
"This is just a simplification. Plugins can do a lot more than just "
"decorating route callbacks, but it is a good starting point. Lets have a "
"look at some code::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:36
msgid ""
"This plugin measures the execution time for each request and adds an "
"appropriate ``X-Exec-Time`` header to the response. As you can see, the "
"plugin returns a wrapper and the wrapper calls the original callback "
"recursively. This is how decorators usually work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:38
msgid ""
"The last line tells Bottle to install the plugin to the default application."
" This causes the plugin to be automatically applied to all routes of that "
"application. In other words, ``stopwatch()`` is called once for each route "
"callback and the return value is used as a replacement for the original "
"callback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:40
msgid ""
"Plugins are applied on demand, that is, as soon as a route is requested for "
"the first time. For this to work properly in multi-threaded environments, "
"the plugin should be thread-safe. This is not a problem most of the time, "
"but keep it in mind."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:42
msgid ""
"Once all plugins are applied to a route, the wrapped callback is cached and "
"subsequent requests are handled by the cached version directly. This means "
"that a plugin is usually applied only once to a specific route. That cache, "
"however, is cleared every time the list of installed plugins changes. Your "
"plugin should be able to decorate the same route more than once."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:44
msgid ""
"The decorator API is quite limited, though. You don't know anything about "
"the route being decorated or the associated application object and have no "
"way to efficiently store data that is shared among all routes. But fear not!"
" Plugins are not limited to just decorator functions. Bottle accepts "
"anything as a plugin as long as it is callable or implements an extended "
"API. This API is described below and gives you a lot of control over the "
"whole process."

msgid "Plugin API"
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:50
msgid ""
":class:`Plugin` is not a real class (you cannot import it from "
":mod:`bottle`) but an interface that plugins are expected to implement. "
"Bottle accepts any object of any type as a plugin, as long as it conforms to"
" the following API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:54
msgid ""
"Plugins must be callable or implement :meth:`apply`. If :meth:`apply` is "
"defined, it is always preferred over calling the plugin directly. All other "
"methods and attributes are optional."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:58
msgid ""
"Both :meth:`Bottle.uninstall` and the `skip` parameter of "
":meth:`Bottle.route()` accept a name string to refer to a plugin or plugin "
"type. This works only for plugins that have a name attribute."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:62
msgid ""
"The Plugin API is still evolving. This integer attribute tells bottle which "
"version to use. If it is missing, bottle defaults to the first version. The "
"current version is ``2``. See :ref:`plugin-changelog` for details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:66
msgid ""
"Called as soon as the plugin is installed to an application (see "
":meth:`Bottle.install`). The only parameter is the associated application "
"object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:70
msgid ""
"As long as :meth:`apply` is not defined, the plugin itself is used as a "
"decorator and applied directly to each route callback. The only parameter is"
" the callback to decorate. Whatever is returned by this method replaces the "
"original callback. If there is no need to wrap or replace a given callback, "
"just return the unmodified callback parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:74
msgid ""
"If defined, this method is used in favor of :meth:`__call__` to decorate "
"route callbacks. The additional `route` parameter is an instance of "
":class:`Route` and provides a lot of meta-information and context for that "
"route. See :ref:`route-context` for details."

"The Plugin API is still evolving and changed with Bottle 0.10 to address "

"In some rare cases, however, it might be justifiable to break this rule. "
"After you made your changes to the :class:`Route` instance, raise "

"however. Changes to `rule` or `method` values have no effect on the router, "
"but only on plugins. This may change in the future, though."

msgid "Runtime optimizations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:139
msgid ""
"Once all plugins are applied to a route, the wrapped route callback is "
"cached to speed up subsequent requests. If the behavior of your plugin "
"depends on configuration, and you want to be able to change that "
"configuration at runtime, you need to read the configuration on each "
"request. Easy enough."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:141
msgid ""
"For performance reasons, however, it might be worthwhile to choose a "
"different wrapper based on current needs, work with closures, or enable or "
"disable a plugin at runtime. Let's take the built-in HooksPlugin as an "
"example: If no hooks are installed, the plugin removes itself from all "
"affected routes and has virtaully no overhead. As soon as you install the "
"first hook, the plugin activates itself and takes effect again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:143
msgid ""
"To achieve this, you need control over the callback cache: "
":meth:`Route.reset` clears the cache for a single route and "
":meth:`Bottle.reset` clears all caches for all routes of an application at "
"once. On the next request, all plugins are re-applied to the route as if it "
"were requested for the first time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:145

#: ../../plugindev.rst:151
msgid ""
"This plugin provides an sqlite3 database connection handle as an additional "
"keyword argument to wrapped callbacks, but only if the callback expects it. "
"If not, the route is ignored and no overhead is added. The wrapper does not "
"affect the return value, but handles plugin-related exceptions properly. "
":meth:`Plugin.setup` is used to inspect the application and search for "
"conflicting plugins."

"This plugin is actually useful and very similar to the version bundled with "
"Bottle. Not bad for less than 60 lines of code, don't you think? Here is a "
"usage example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../plugindev.rst:239
msgid ""
"The first route needs a database connection and tells the plugin to create a"
" handle by requesting a ``db`` keyword argument. The second route does not "
"need a database and is therefore ignored by the plugin. The third route does"
" expect a 'db' keyword argument, but explicitly skips the sqlite plugin. "
"This way the argument is not overruled by the plugin and still contains the "
"value of the same-named url argument."
