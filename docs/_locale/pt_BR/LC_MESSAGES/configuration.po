"Bottle applications can store their configuration in :attr:`Bottle.config`, "
"a dict-like object and central place for application specific settings. This"
" dictionary controls many aspects of the framework, tells (newer) plugins "
"what to do, and can be used to store your own configuration as well."

"The :attr:`Bottle.config` object behaves a lot like an ordinary dictionary. "

"To make life easier, plugins and applications should follow some simple "

"identifiers (no special characters but the underscore)."

"The ``config`` hook on the application object is triggered each time a value"
" in :attr:`Bottle.config` is changed. This hook can be used to react on "
"configuration changes at runtime, for example reconnect to a new database, "
"change the debug settings on a background service or resize worker thread "
"pools. The hook callback receives two arguments (key, new_value) and is "
"called before the value is actually changed in the dictionary. Raising an "
"exception from a hook callback cancels the change and the old value is "
"preserved."
