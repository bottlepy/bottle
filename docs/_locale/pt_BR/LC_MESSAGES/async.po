"Asynchronous design patterns don't mix well with the synchronous nature of "
"`WSGI <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_. This is why most "
"asynchronous frameworks (tornado, twisted, ...) implement a specialized API "
"to expose their asynchronous features. Bottle is a WSGI framework and shares"
" the synchronous nature of WSGI, but thanks to the awesome `gevent project "
"<http://www.gevent.org/>`_, it is still possible to write asynchronous "
"applications with bottle. This article documents the usage of Bottle with "
"Asynchronous WSGI."

"Briefly worded, the `WSGI specification (pep 3333) "
"<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_ defines a request/response "
"circle as follows: The application callable is invoked once for each request"
" and must return a body iterator. The server then iterates over the body and"
" writes each chunk to the socket. As soon as the body iterator is exhausted,"
" the client connection is closed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../async.rst:11
msgid ""
"Simple enough, but there is a snag: All this happens synchronously. If your "
"application needs to wait for data (IO, sockets, databases, ...), it must "
"either yield empty strings (busy wait) or block the current thread. Both "
"solutions occupy the handling thread and prevent it from answering new "
"requests. There is consequently only one ongoing request per thread."

"Most servers limit the number of threads to avoid their relatively high "
"overhead. Pools of 20 or less threads are common. As soon as all threads are"
" occupied, any new connection is stalled. The server is effectively dead for"
" everyone else. If you want to implement a chat that uses long-polling ajax "
"requests to get real-time updates, you'd reach the limited at 20 concurrent "
"connections. That's a pretty small chat."

#: ../../async.rst:18
msgid ""
"Most servers limit the size of their worker pools to a relatively low number"
" of concurrent threads, due to the high overhead involved in switching "
"between and creating new threads. While threads are cheap compared to "
"processes (forks), they are still expensive to create for each new "
"connection."

msgid ""
"The `gevent <http://www.gevent.org/>`_ module adds *greenlets* to the mix. "
"Greenlets behave similar to traditional threads, but are very cheap to "
"create. A gevent-based server can spawn thousands of greenlets (one for each"
" connection) with almost no overhead. Blocking individual greenlets has no "
"impact on the servers ability to accept new requests. The number of "
"concurrent connections is virtually unlimited."
msgstr ""

#: ../../async.rst:22
msgid ""
"This makes creating asynchronous applications incredibly easy, because they "
"look and feel like synchronous applications. A gevent-based server is "
"actually not asynchronous, but massively multi-threaded. Here is an "
"example::"

#: ../../async.rst:39
msgid ""
"The first line is important. It causes gevent to monkey-patch most of "
"Python's blocking APIs to not block the current thread, but pass the CPU to "
"the next greenlet instead. It actually replaces Python's threading with "
"gevent-based pseudo-threads. This is why you can still use ``time.sleep()`` "
"which would normally block the whole thread. If you don't feel comfortable "
"with monkey-patching python built-ins, you can use the corresponding gevent "
"functions (``gevent.sleep()`` in this case)."

"If you run this script and point your browser to "
"``http://localhost:8080/stream``, you should see `START`, `MIDDLE`, and "
"`END` show up one by one (rather than waiting 8 seconds to see them all at "
"once). It works exactly as with normal threads, but now your server can "
"handle thousands of concurrent requests without any problems."

"Some browsers buffer a certain amount of data before they start rendering a "
"page. You might need to yield more than a few bytes to see an effect in "
"these browsers. Additionally, many browsers have a limit of one concurrent "
"connection per URL. If this is the case, you can use a second browser or a "
"benchmark tool (e.g. `ab` or `httperf`) to measure performance."

msgid ""
"A very common design pattern in asynchronous frameworks (including tornado, "
"twisted, node.js and friends) is to use non-blocking APIs and bind callbacks"
" to asynchronous events. The socket object is kept open until it is closed "
"explicitly to allow callbacks to write to the socket at a later point. Here "
"is an example based on the `tornado library "
"<http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation#non-blocking-asynchronous-"
"requests>`_::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../async.rst:63
msgid ""
"The main benefit is that the request handler terminates early. The handling "
"thread can move on and accept new requests while the callbacks continue to "
"write to sockets of previous requests. This is how these frameworks manage "
"to process a lot of concurrent requests with only a small number of OS "
"threads."
msgstr ""

#: ../../async.rst:65
msgid ""
"With Gevent+WSGI, things are different: First, terminating early has no "
"benefit because we have an unlimited pool of (pseudo)threads to accept new "
"connections. Second, we cannot terminate early because that would close the "
"socket (as required by WSGI). Third, we must return an iterable to conform "
"to WSGI."
msgstr ""

#: ../../async.rst:67
msgid ""
"In order to conform to the WSGI standard, all we have to do is to return a "
"body iterable that we can write to asynchronously. With the help of "
"`gevent.queue <http://www.gevent.org/gevent.queue.html>`_, we can *simulate*"
" a detached socket and rewrite the previous example as follows::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../async.rst:78
msgid ""
"From the server perspective, the queue object is iterable. It blocks if "
"empty and stops as soon as it reaches ``StopIteration``. This conforms to "
"WSGI. On the application side, the queue object behaves like a non-blocking "
"socket. You can write to it at any time, pass it around and even start a new"
" (pseudo)thread that writes to it asynchronously. This is how long-polling "
"is implemented most of the time."
