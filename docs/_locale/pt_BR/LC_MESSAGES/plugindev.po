"The plugin API builds on the concept of `decorators "
"<http://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-decorator>`_. To put it briefly, "
"a plugin is a decorator applied to every single route callback of an "
"application."

"This plugin measures the execution time for each request and adds an "
"appropriate ``X-Exec-Time`` header to the response. As you can see, the "
"plugin returns a wrapper and the wrapper calls the original callback "
"recursively. This is how decorators usually work."

"The last line tells Bottle to install the plugin to the default application."
" This causes the plugin to be automatically applied to all routes of that "
"application. In other words, ``stopwatch()`` is called once for each route "
"callback and the return value is used as a replacement for the original "
"callback."

"Plugins are applied on demand, that is, as soon as a route is requested for "
"the first time. For this to work properly in multi-threaded environments, "
"the plugin should be thread-safe. This is not a problem most of the time, "

"Once all plugins are applied to a route, the wrapped callback is cached and "
"subsequent requests are handled by the cached version directly. This means "
"that a plugin is usually applied only once to a specific route. That cache, "
"however, is cleared every time the list of installed plugins changes. Your "
"plugin should be able to decorate the same route more than once."

"The decorator API is quite limited, though. You don't know anything about "
"the route being decorated or the associated application object and have no "
"way to efficiently store data that is shared among all routes. But fear not!"
" Plugins are not limited to just decorator functions. Bottle accepts "
"anything as a plugin as long as it is callable or implements an extended "
"API. This API is described below and gives you a lot of control over the "
"whole process."
