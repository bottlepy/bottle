* **Templates:** Fast and pythonic `*built-in template engine* <http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#tutorial-templates>`_ and support for mako_, jinja2_ and cheetah_ templates.
* **Utilities:** Convenient access to form data, file uploads, cookies, headers and other HTTP-related metadata.
* **Server:** Built-in HTTP development server and support for paste_, fapws3_, bjoern_, `Google App Engine <http://code.google.com/intl/en-US/appengine/>`_, cherrypy_ or any other WSGI_ capable HTTP server.

Example: "Hello World" in a bottle
----------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

  from bottle import route, run, template

  @route('/hello/<name>')
  def index(name):
      return template('<b>Hello {{name}}</b>!', name=name)

  run(host='localhost', port=8080)

Run this script or paste it into a Python console, then point your browser to `<http://localhost:8080/hello/world>`_. That's it.
